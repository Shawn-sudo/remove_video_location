## remove_video_location

`remove_video_location` is a Flutter plugin that strips selected metadata from video files **without re-encoding**. The plugin remuxes the original tracks using platform-native frameworks so the process stays fast and lossless.

### 💡 Why this plugin?

It's important to remove location metadata from user-uploaded videos to protect privacy and prevent location-based stalking. FFmpeg-based solutions are too large and complex to bundle, while EXIF-focused plugins only work for photos. `remove_video_location` addresses that gap with a focused, minimal package built specifically for removing location metadata of videos.

The plugin delegates directly to native frameworks: `AVFoundation` on iOS and `MediaExtractor`/`MediaMuxer` on Android—to clear location metadata without re-encoding. By relying on the capabilities already shipped with each platform, the package stays small, fast, and dependency-free.

### Features

- Remove GPS coordinates (ISO 6709 metadata) from videos.
- Optionally drop container-level creation timestamps.
- Zero re-encoding – video and audio samples are copied as-is.
- Works on Android (MediaExtractor/MediaMuxer) and iOS (AVFoundation).

### Installation

Add the dependency to your `pubspec.yaml`:

```yaml
dependencies:
  remove_video_location: ^0.0.1
```

Then fetch packages:

```sh
flutter pub get
```

### Usage

```dart
import 'package:remove_video_location/remove_video_location.dart';

Future<void> cleanVideo() async {
  final cleanedPath = await RemoveVideoLocation.instance.removeMetadata(
    inputPath: '/storage/emulated/0/DCIM/Camera/VID_123.mp4',
    fields: const {
      VideoMetadataField.location,
      VideoMetadataField.creationTimestamp,
    },
  );

  // Use the cleaned video file.
  print('Metadata removed → $cleanedPath');
}
```

By default the plugin writes a sibling file with the suffix `_clean`. Pass an `outputPath` if you need full control over the destination and set `overwrite: true` to replace existing files.

### Platform notes

- **Android**: Uses `MediaExtractor` and `MediaMuxer` to remux the video. Location metadata is only retained if you do not request its removal. Creation timestamps are regenerated by the muxer; enabling their removal prevents the original value from being copied into the remuxed file.
- **iOS**: Uses `AVAssetExportSession` with `AVAssetExportPresetPassthrough` and filters metadata via `AVMetadataItem` identifiers before exporting.

### Limitations

- Only the listed metadata fields are currently removed.
- You must pass file-system paths that your app can read and write. Request the necessary storage permissions on Android when accessing shared storage.
